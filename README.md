\#  This branch is called "feature/bit-communication". In this branch, you will see the development of bit manipulation.<br  />
\#  By means of bit manipulation, all of the requests coming from exposed the HTTP REST endpoint will be converted to a byte array, and <br  />
\#  manipulated in the byte form.<br  />
