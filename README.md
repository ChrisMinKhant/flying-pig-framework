==> WE ALL ARE TALKING IN BIT <==

#  This branch is called "feature/bit-communication". In this branch, you will see the development of bit manipulation.
#  By means of bit manipulation, all of the requests coming from exposed the HTTP REST endpoint will be converted to a byte array and 
#  manipulated in the byte form.

==> CAUTION! <==

#  Please be aware of weird kinds of stuff. This whole project won't intend to help solve the problem. Since all the features you will see are
#  just to make crazy things and probably create some problems as extras.
